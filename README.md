# LTWK
A first step into Android development, trying to create a Tower Defense game using my own "Gaming enginge" (if you can call it like that)
Using Android Surface View and many sprites found on internet.

As soon as the project will be over, I'll credited every people who have his own piece of software / art into my project.

If you see this, recognize some of your work, and don't have credit for it, please tell me :)
